`asm asm-qualifiers ( AssemblerInstructions )`

> volatile  
    
    The optional volatile qualifier has no effect. All basic asm blocks are implicitly volatile.  


>inline

    If you use the inline qualifier, then for inlining purposes the size of the asm statement is taken as the smallest size possible (see Size of an asm).
